<a name="log5" class="anchor" href="#log5"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Log 5: Presentation on Your Object's Material History</h2>
<p>Hello, everyone! On Wednesday, February 26th, each of you will present briefly on the material history of your objects, picking up on the discussions (about production, consumption, reuse, and disposal) we had during the week of February 17th.</p>
<p>Your presentations will each be approximately three-minutes-long, timed, and informal (i.e., intended for your 250 peers and me). During the presentation, you should use media (images, audio, video, or the like) embedded or otherwise included (as Log 5) in your DHUM 250 website (at yoursite/index.html). Just before your presentation, you'll load your website for the class to view. Put this way, it will operate like a slide deck or other such presentation medium.</p>

<p>With Wednesday's presentations in mind, in your research log please include the following media about your object's material history:<ul>
<li>One media file (e.g., JPG, GIF, embedded video) about where your object (in whole or in part) comes from (or you think it comes from); </li>
<li>One media file (e.g., JPG, GIF, embedded video) about how your object (in whole or in part) is used/consumed/advertised, by or to whom, and in what contexts; and</li>
<li>One media file (e.g., JPG, GIF, embedded video) about how your object (in whole or in part) is reused/repurposed/disposed of, where, and by whom (or so you assume).</li>
</ul></p>
<p>As you present (again, for approximately three minutes), please walk us through these three media, while also addressing the following (to the best of your knowledge):<ul>
<li>Where does your object (in whole or in part) come from, and under what conditions is it made? Here, feel free to conjecture where necessary.</li>
<li>How is your object (in whole or in part) advertised? To whom? By whom? Under what assumptions?</li>
<li>When your object is rendered "obsolete," where does it go? To what effects? Again, feel free to conjecture where necessary.</li></ul></p>

<p>Please note: your presentations should consume nearly all of your allotted three minutes, and you will be timed. After all of your presentations, we'll have a brief discussion as a class. In other words, the Q&A period will follow all presentations, not each presentation.</p> 
<p>Get in touch with any questions or concerns. Thanks again!</p>
