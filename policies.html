<h3>Attendance</h3>

<p>Students are expected to attend all classes in which they are enrolled. A department may require a student to withdraw from a course if the student is registered in another course that conflicts with it in time. An instructor may refuse a student admission to a lecture because of lateness, misconduct, inattention, or failure to meet the responsibilities of the course. Students who neglect their academic work, including assignments may be refused permission to write the final examination in a course. Students who are absent because of illness, an accident, or family affliction should report to me upon their return to classes.</p>

<p>Aside from attending for the sake of attending, I create several incentives for students to come to class. Those incentives include: (1) sparking ideas and topics for your log entries, 2) asking you to conduct presentations, 3) holding hands-on workshops, and 4) encouraging face-to-face discussions amongst students about the assigned materials. </p>

<h3>Computers in the Classroom</h3>

<p>Given the applied nature of this course, I recommend bringing a laptop to class meetings. But a laptop is by no means required. You will, however, need access to a computer outside of the classroom. If you do not own a computer, then please notify me. I will direct you to resources on campus.</p>  

<h3>Late and Missed Submissions </h3>

<p>Barring written documentation of illness, an accident, or family affliction, all log entries must be submitted prior to the class meeting when they are due, meaning I will not mark late submissions. All missed assignments will receive a zero.</p>  

<h3>Email</h3>

<p>With the exception of holidays and weekends, I respond to student emails within twenty-four hours.</p>

<h3>Learning Climate</h3>

<p>The University of Victoria is committed to promoting, providing, and protecting a positive, supportive, and safe working and learning environment for all its members. Students and faculty members are expected to adhere to the UVic human rights policy. Students should alert me immediately if they have any questions about this policy and its application, or if they have concerns about course proceedings or participants.</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity</h3>

<p>Students are expected to adhere to the UVic academic integrity policy. Violations of this policy will result in a failing grade for the given assignment and may additionally result in a failing grade for the course. By taking this course, students agree that all submitted assignments may be subject to an originality review.</p>

<h3>Writing Improvement</h3>

<p>I may require students to seek general writing improvement and/or assignment tutoring at The Learning and Teaching Centre. If so, then they will be required to do so and to rewrite their work within three weeks of receiving notice from me. </p>

<h3>Accessibility</h3>

<p>Students with diverse learning styles and needs are welcome in this course. In particular, if you have a special need/health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach me and/or the Resource Centre for Students with a Disability (RCSD) as soon as possible. The RCSD staff are available by appointment to assess specific needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let us know your needs, the quicker we can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.</p>
