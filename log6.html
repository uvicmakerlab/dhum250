<p>Hello, DHUM 250. I hope this prompt finds you well. Based on the discovery and metadata workshop we conducted on March 5th, in this log entry (#6), please provide the following: <ul>
<li>For your model, the Dublin Core metadata for the following elements: "coverage," "creator," "contributor," "date," "description," "format," "relation," "rights," "source," "subject," "title," and "type." Please make every effort to complete each field. Where a field is difficult (or impossible) to complete, please say why. Where it is not applicable, please say so. In your log, you can just provide this metadata in point form (using <code><li></code> or the like). </li>
<li>A brief statement (50-100 words) on how "discovering" or finding your object differs across its digital and physical form, or across online and offline environments. In other words, if you were looking for your model online, then how would find it? If you were looking for it offline, then how would you find it?</li> 
<li>A brief statement (50 words) on why this differences between these two types of discovery (digital and physical, or online and offline) matter.</li> 
</ul></p>

<p>Get in touch with any questions or concerns. Thanks again!</p>
